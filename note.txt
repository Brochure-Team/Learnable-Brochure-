Below 20% - did not attend - 0% attendance for the day 

Below 40% Above 20% - did not complete - 50% attendance for the day 

Above 40% - completed - 100% attendance for the day
The cumulation of the attendance percentage for the day divided by the number of sessions will give the attendance score
E.g 

SOTU 1 - 100% 
Q&A - 50% 
SOTU 2 - 100% 

Total - 250% 
Number of classes - 3 

Attendance score for the period - 250/3 = 83.3%
